# teamprofile_generator

## Description

This Team Profile Generator allows for a manager to add other employees such as engineers and interns into a team. Each employee has specific questions that relates to their role within the company. For an engineer, the questions that are prompted include their name, email, id number, role, and Github username. For an intern, the questions include their name, email, id number, role, and school they attend. As the questions are answered, the answers are generated within the team.html file showing each employee and their specific information within the already created html cards.
