# teamprofile_generator

## Description

This Team Profile Generator allows for a manager to add other employees such as engineers and interns into a team. Each employee has specific questions that relates to their role within the company. For an engineer, the questions that are prompted include their name, email, id number, role, and Github username. For an intern, the questions include their name, email, id number, role, and school they attend. As the questions are answered, the answers are generated within the team.html file showing each employee and their specific information within the already created html cards.

## Tests

My code passed all of the tests although not locally. My instructor and TA's tried to resolve the issue on my local machine as to why jest was not installing correctly but we could not resolve the issue. My code passes all of the tests on Mac users but since I am a PC user we think that could be the issue. I included an image below of the code passing the tests.

## Problems

Getting jest installed. Jest works locally for other activities but did not want to work for this project for some reason. Other than that, minor issues of debugging.

## Credits

Credit goes to my instructor Gary and my TA's Maria and Leo. Maria happens to also be my tutor and she continues to help me with any questions or concerns I have.
